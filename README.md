## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a great exercise for me to start applying the basics of HTML and CSS that I had been reading about. It got me thinking about various ways to accomplish goals that, although appearing simple, proved to be more challenging than I had expected.
I learned more about the flexbox layout, as well as strategies for sizing and arranging elements on the page. I also learned more about using fonts and media queries. 

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable using flexbox and other layouts, as well as learn more best practices for HTML and CSS overall. I would also like to keep training my eye to recognize visual details like spacing and size.

### Useful resources
